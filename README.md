# Ink by Marrow

Local-first markdown notes, PDF editor, and unlimited canvas.

## What is Ink?

Ink by Marrow is a cross-platform note-taking application built on a **local-first, markdown-file architecture**. Every note is a `.md` file, every asset lives alongside it, and you always own your data. Ink is also a **full-featured PDF editor**: annotate, highlight, sign, and manage PDFs as first-class citizens — all edits written directly into the file.

## Features

- **Markdown Notes** — WYSIWYG editing with Tiptap, wiki-links, slash commands, frontmatter, tags, templates
- **PDF Editor** — View, annotate, highlight, draw, sign, manage pages, merge/split, form filling
- **Unlimited Canvas** — Infinite whiteboard with freehand drawing, text cards, sticky notes, connectors
- **PDF File Browser** — Grid/list view with thumbnails, import, sort, filter, batch operations
- **Full-Text Search** — Instant search across all notes and PDFs with MiniSearch
- **Offline-First** — Works entirely in the browser without a network connection

## Vault Structure

Ink stores everything as files in a vault (folder):

```
my-vault/
├── _marrow/          # App metadata (config, templates, snapshots)
├── _inbox/           # PDF import landing zone
├── Projects/         # User folders with .md, .pdf, .canvas files
├── Journal/          # Date-titled daily notes
└── inbox.md          # Default capture note
```

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–12):** Web MVP — markdown editor, PDF browser/editor, unlimited canvas, four-view navigation, offline support
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 13–18):** Desktop app (Tauri), templates, graph view, Marrow Sync
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 19–26):** Mobile (Capacitor), stylus support, OCR, plugin system, public launch
