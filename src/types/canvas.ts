/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * Canvas file format version.
 *
 *   v2 — legacy. Migrated via `migrateV2ToV3` on read; never written.
 *   v3 — single JSON file. Each layer inlines its pixel data as a base64
 *        PNG data URL in `CanvasLayerData.imageData`. Dense 5-layer
 *        documents could balloon to 10–25 MB of inline JSON — slow to
 *        parse, slow to sync, visible pain in Dropbox. Read-only now.
 *   v4 — sidecar-PNG-beside-file format. JSON holds metadata; pixel PNGs
 *        lived at `<canvasPath>.assets/<layerId>.png`. Clutters the
 *        vault with visible sidecar folders next to every `.canvas` and
 *        couples file-rename semantics to the pixel folder. Readable but
 *        no longer written.
 *   v5 — current. JSON holds metadata plus a stable `assetId` UUID; pixel
 *        PNGs live in a hidden per-canvas subdirectory under the vault's
 *        `_marrow/_drawings/<assetId>/`. The `assetId` is generated once
 *        on first save and never rotates, so renaming the `.canvas` file
 *        leaves its pixel folder untouched — the id travels with the JSON,
 *        not the filename. `CanvasLayerData.imageData` is always `null`.
 *
 * v3 and v4 files remain readable; both get rewritten as v5 on the next
 * save. v4 → v5 migration leaves the old `.assets/` folder on disk as
 * dead weight — same orphan policy as deleted-layer PNGs.

 *     now pressures the JS heap only by the blob *handles* (a few bytes

 *     3 bytes of payload).
 *   - Restoration via `createImageBitmap(blob)` is faster than the
 *     `HTMLImageElement + data URL` path and decodes off the main thread
 *     on browsers that support it.
 *
 * Disk format (`CanvasLayerData.imageData`) stays base64 — see BUG-13 for

 *                         original stack position, with its full metadata
 *                         and last-known pixel data.
 *   - `reorder-layers`  → replace the layer stack order. Stores just the
 *                         before/after id arrays — pixel data is untouched,
 *                         so these entries are tiny (~N strings each).
