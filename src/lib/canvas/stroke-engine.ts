/**
 * Processes pointer events into strokes.
 *
 * On pointerdown: begins a new stroke, stamps the initial point.
 * On pointermove: collects points, interpolates via Catmull-Rom, stamps.
 * On pointerup:
 *   - Normal strokes: commit the scratchpad to the active layer.
 *   - Eraser strokes: no-op — stamps were already rendered straight into
 *     the active layer with blendMode='erase'.
 *
 * Why does the eraser bypass the scratchpad?
 * The scratchpad pattern works for *additive* ink (accumulate stamps into
 * an RT, composite once with normal blend so opacity is bounded to the
 * stroke's settings). Erase semantics are fundamentally different — each
 * stamp must subtract alpha from pixels already on the layer. Rendering
 * Graphics → layer RT with `blendMode='erase'` does exactly that.
 * Applying `'erase'` at commit time via the scratchpad Sprite was
 * unreliable in practice (appeared as translucent grey paint on some
 * backends because the scratchpad RT stores premultiplied alpha and the
 * sprite's blend pass doesn't always respect it). Direct-to-layer erase
 * is the canonical Pixi path and also gives the user real-time feedback
 * as pixels disappear.
