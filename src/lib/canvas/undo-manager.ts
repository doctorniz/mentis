 *
 *   - `stroke`       → replace pixels on a set of layers by blitting a
 *                      previously-captured base64 PNG back into each
 *                      layer's RenderTexture.
 *   - `remove-layer` → re-create a deleted layer in its original stack
 *                      position with full metadata + pixel data.
 *
 * Pushing a new entry always clears the redo stack (standard undo
 * semantics — branching history is explicitly not supported).
