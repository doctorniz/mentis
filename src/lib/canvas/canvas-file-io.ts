/**
 * Persist a canvas engine's state to disk in the v5 drawings-folder
 * format.
 *
 *   - PNGs live under `_marrow/_drawings/<assetId>/<layerId>.png` —
 *     hidden from the vault tree and decoupled from the `.canvas` file's
 *     name. Renaming the `.canvas` never touches this folder.
 *   - JSON carries `assetId` so the link survives rename.
 *
 * Write order (intentional for crash-safety):
 *
 *   1. Ensure the engine has an `assetId`. Minted here on first save if
 *      absent (brand-new canvas, or migration from v3/v4).
 *   2. Extract every layer's pixels as a PNG Blob from the GPU. Done
 *      BEFORE any disk write so a mid-save crash can't leave the JSON
 *      pointing at half-written PNGs.
 *   3. `mkdir` the drawings sub-directory (idempotent — includes all
 *      parents, so `_marrow/_drawings/` is created if missing).
 *   4. Write each layer's PNG. A failed blob (GPU extract returned
 *      null) is skipped rather than deleting the prior PNG — leaving
 *      the last good bytes on disk is strictly better than overwriting
 *      them with nothing.
 *   5. Write the JSON metadata LAST. Any reader that sees a successful
 *      JSON save is guaranteed to see the PNGs it references.
 *
 * Orphan handling is deliberately out of scope:
 *   - Deleted layers leave their PNGs in the drawings folder.
 *   - v4 → v5 migration leaves the old `<canvasPath>.assets/` folder
 *     untouched on disk.
 *   Both are the same policy as `_marrow/snapshots/` PDF backups; a
 *   vault-wide cleanup pass can reap them later.
